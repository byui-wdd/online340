        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This course prepares students to plan, develop, and construct dynamic

          common design patterns.
          <strong
            >This is a programming course; previous programming experience will
            be helpful.</strong
          >

        <h2 id="objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          You will demonstrate both the knowledge and skills to create dynamic
          web sites using:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enforce current standards of validity &amp; best practice in the web
            frontend.
          </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          This course is another step to become a web developer, which requires
          you to both know and do. In order to know something you must study,
          reflect and practice. To do requires effort and application to
          implement your knowledge. This class requires both knowing and doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contrary to many classrooms where you work alone, this class
          <strong>requires</strong> you to work with others. You will form
          learning teams and these teams will be a primary source to turn to for
          help and feedback. However, ultimately <strong>YOU</strong> are
          responsible for your learning and for the results of your efforts.
        </p>

        <h2 id="summative">Assessments</h2>
        <p>
          Each listed assessment relates directly to one or more course
          objectives, indicated in brackets. Specific due dates are listed in
          the assessment document. All assessments will be posted to your own
          web site; once posted, an assessment should remain unchanged until the
          grade appears in the grade book. The professor and/or teaching
          assistant (TA) will grade each assessment, using a provided grading
          matrix.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is <strong>YOUR</strong> responsibility to thoroughly read and
          understand the specification for each assessment and <b>test</b> your
          own work prior to your work being submitted. Self and peer reviews
          using the grading matrix prior to due dates is encouraged.
        </p>

        <h3>Teaching Presentation [Objective 6]</h3>
        <p>
          Select a topic from the Teaching Presentation List and develop a
          7-minute (maximum) teaching presentation where you will teach others
          about the topic. Read the specific requirements for the teaching
          presentation and view the grading matrix for the teaching presentation
          in the Teaching Presentation module.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhancements [various]</h3>
        <p>
          Each enhancement requires you to solve problems and demonstrate
          application of a variety of backend, frontend, database, and design
          patterns, and related concepts. Each enhancement will require you to
          submit your solution code to the appropriate assignment, as well as
          other artifacts as described in the enhancement directions.
          Enhancements are found in the modules and are directly related to the
          topics of study for that module.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaboration [Objective. 6]</h3>
        <p>
          A skill that is consistently mentioned by employers is the ability to
          work with others. You will be required to work with others on a weekly
          basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each
          individual is responsible for their own work, but interacting,
          supporting, assisting and collaborating are desirable and required in
          this class.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Project [All Objectives]</h3>
        <p>
          You will build a final project web application to specifications
          provided to you in the final weeks of the term. The project will allow
          you flexibility and creativity while demonstrating your ability to
          implement the concepts and skills of this course. The finished project
          is due at the conclusion of week 13 of the semester as specified in
          the class schedule. This is a major element of the course. Read the
          project description in the Final Project module when it becomes
          available.
        </p>

        <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Grading in this course is competency based. This means that your grade
          is based on your
          <b>demonstrated competency of each course objective</b>. Each
          assessment is tied and scored directly to one or more course
          objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your grade in the course is based on the number of course objectives
          of which you have demonstrated mastery.
          <b
            >Passing course objectives, not the gross percentage of the class,
            determines the final course grade.</b
          >
          Each objective is graded Pass / Fail. To pass an objective you must
          earn at least 80% of the points allocated to it. It is critical that
          you are always doing your best work, on time and error free &mdash;
          <b>Do not submit junk!</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Course Grade Scale</h2>
        <table id="gradetable">
          <tr>
            <th>Objectives Passed</th>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Grade Earned</th>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>C+</td>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>C-</td>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>D-</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Late Work</h2>
        <p>
          Consult the "Late Work" document in the "Helps &amp; Resources" folder
          for your class late work policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Warning</h2>
        <p>
          <b>You must be self-motivation to succeed in this course.</b> There
          are expectations of constant learning and application &mdash; be
          anxiously engaged! Previous students have commented that you can do
          well in this course only if you stay caught up and work to grasp the
          concepts and apply them. Take their advice!
          <strong
            >It is expected that you will dedicate a minimum of 9 hours per week
            on this class. Do not plan less.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h2 id="help">Getting Help</h2>
        <p>
          Students frequently find that they need help and there are a number of
          ways of getting help: 1) your learning team, 2) the teaching
          assistant, 3) the open lab (on campus), 4) tutors and 5) the
          professor. It is not a matter of if, rather when, you will need help.
          Act quickly when you need help. Do NOT put it off!

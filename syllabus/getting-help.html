    <h1>Getting Help</h1>
    <p>There are multiple avenues of help, but keep in mind that you must have tried to solve the problem yourself prior to seeking help from others.</p>
    <p><b>Your Peers</b> - it is expected and required for you to work together in your learning teams to help one another by meeting face-to-face, calling one another, using virtual software (MS Teams, Google Meet, etc...).</p>
    <p><b>Discussion Board</b> - use the weekly discussion board to post and answer questions related to the topic of the week. You can also share insights and outside resources that can benefit others.</p>
    <p><b>Teaching Assistant</b> - contact the teaching assistant to get help and answer your questions. </p>
    <p><b>Professor</b> - Click the "professor" button on the Home page for information on how to schedule an appointment with the professor.</p>
    <p><b>Open Lab</b> there is a drop-in lab in the STC building. There you will find lab assistants who can help you during its hours of operation.</p>

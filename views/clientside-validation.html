        <h1>Client-side Form Validation</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Validating the inputs from a form is critical to ensuring that the
          data you expect is the data you receive. When done in the browser it
          does not require data be sent to the server prior to being validated.
          The term "<abbr>Client-side</abbr>" refers to checking data while in
          the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          Checking data in the browser is typically done using
          <b>Native HTML5 Methods</b> or using <b>JavaScript</b>. This document
          will discuss using native HTML5 methods.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>The video provides a general overview of the activity, but does not contain the detail needed to complete each process. Watch the video to obtain a general idea, but follow the written steps to complete the activity. This is the <a target="_blank" href="../transcripts/client-side-validation.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>
       <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn5RyFnl2wA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2>The 'required' attribute</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest change you can make to a form is to mark an input field
          as 'required':
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;account_firstname&quot; required&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          This informs the web browser that the field is mandatory. Most
          browsers will mark the input box in some way if the client fails to
          complete the input correctly. You can actually create your own
          valid/invalid formatting using CSS to override the browser default.
          You should be aware that the CSS pseudo-classes for doing this are
          currently considered experimental and may result in CSS validation
          errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Different input types</h2>
        <p>
          Along with the text input type, there are a host of other options,
          including email, url, number, tel, date and others.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the iPhone/iPad and other mobile devices the different input types
          are associated with different keyboards, making it easier for people
          to complete your online forms. In web browsers they can be used in
          combination with the required attribute to limit or give advice on
          allowable input values. For example:
        </p>

        <h3>type="email"</h3>

        <p>
          By changing the input type to email while also using the required
          attribute, the browser can be used to validate (in a limited fashion)
          email addresses:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;account_email&quot; required placeholder=&quot;Enter a valid email address&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          Note that for this example we've made use of another HTML5 attribute
          <b>placeholder</b> which lets us display a prompt or instructions
          inside the field - something that previously had to be done using
          JavaScript.
          <span class="notice">Using the placeholder should NOT replace the &lt;label&gt; element
            to place a text label adjacent to the input</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>HTML5 input types</h2>
        <p>
          Some additional, common HTML5 input types are shown below. To learn more about each one, or any of the other types, visit
          <a
            href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
            title="opens in a new tab"
            target="_blank"
            >MDN Inputs</a
          >.
        </p>
        <ul style="display:block;" id="html-inputs">
          <li>button</li>
          <li>checkbox</li>
          <li>date</li>
          <li>hidden</li>
          <li>radio</li>
          <li>search</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each type will prompt specific behaviors. For example, the
          <b>tel</b> input type is handy for a mobile device as it selects a
          different input keyboard useful for entering telephone numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >In most cases the browser has a built-in display and validation
            based on the input type, particularly when the "required" attribute
            is added to the input.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h2>Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          The
          <b
            ><a
              href="//www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp"
              title="Opens in a new tab"
              target="_blank"
              >Pattern</a
            ></b
          >
          attribute adds additonal criteria when an input must meet specific
          requirements. Patterns are not always needed, just when a specific
          need exists. HTML5 patterns are actually
          <a
            href="//www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp"
            title="Opens in a new tab"
            target="_blank"
            >JavaScript Regular Expressions</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Pattern Examples</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            IPv4 Address input pattern (four groups of up to 3 numbers separated
            by a period):
          </dt>
          <dd class="language-markup">
            <code>
              &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;
              pattern=&quot;\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}&quot;&gt;
            </code>
          </dd>

          <dt>
            Date input pattern (one or two digits in the first two groups, four
            digits in the last, all separated by slashes):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <code class="language-markup"
              >&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;
              pattern=&quot;\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}&quot;&gt;</code
            >
          </dd>

          <dt>
            Price input pattern (digits followed by a period, followed by two
            digits):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <code class="language-markup">
              &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;
              pattern=&quot;\d+(\.\d{2})?&quot;&gt;
            </code>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        </ul>

        <h2>Styling valid/invalid inputs using CSS</h2>
        <p>
          This first set of styles can be used to mark an input box as
          'invalid', by adding an icon, coloring the text or borders or similar.
          It will apply to inputs that are required but empty, or to inputs that
          have a required format/pattern which hasn't yet been met. These
          pseudo-classes were considered experimental, but no longer are. Their
          use should now pass CSS validation.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-css">input:required:invalid, input:focus:invalid {
 /* insert your own styles for invalid form input */
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          For inputs that are both required and 'valid' you can use the
          following:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-css">input:required:valid {
 /* insert your own styles for valid form input */
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Sample styling using images and sprites</h2>
        <p>
          As shown above, once you've added HTML5 attributes to your form
          elements, they can be easily styled using CSS so that each input field
          is clearly marked as valid or invalid. This also works for textarea
          elements.
        </p>

        <pre
          class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-css">input:required:invalid, input:focus:invalid {
 background-image: url(/images/invalid.png);
 background-position: right top;
 background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
 input:required:valid {
 background-image: url(/images/valid.png);
 background-position: right top;
 background-repeat: no-repeat;
 }</code></pre>
        <hr />
        <h2>Apply Validation</h2>
        <p>
          With a basic introduction to HTML5 validation established let's apply
          it to the <span class="fn">registration</span> and <span class="fn">login</span> views.
        </p>

        <h3>The <span class="fn">Registration</span> View</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <span class="fn">registration</span> view in the editor to alter its code.</li>
          <li>
            Since all fields are "required" make sure you add the "required"
            attribute to all four data input fields (e.g. first name, last name,
            email and password).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure each of the fields has the right type value.
            <ul>
              <li>First name and Last name are both "text".</li>
              <li>Email is type "email".</li>
              <li>Password is type "password".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Let's add a pattern to the password field to make sure the password
            is at least 12 characters and has at least 1 uppercase character, 1
            number and 1 special character.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add a &lt;div&gt; element near the password input. Include the
                password requirements in the div. Use CSS to style it so
                that it is easily read before the input is typed.
              </li>
              <li>Add the pattern attribute and the regular expression to the password input: <mark><code>pattern="^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z0-9])(?!.*\s).{12,}$"</code></mark>.</li>
            </ul>
            This reads, "There must be at least 12 characters, one must be a number, one must be a lowercase letter, one must be a capital letter, and one must be a non-alphanumeric character."
          </li>
          <li>
            When done, the password input could look something like this:
            <pre
              class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-markup">&lt;label for="accountPassword"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;<br> 
&lt;span&gt;Passwords must be at least 12 characters and contain at least 1 number, 1 capital letter and 1 special character&lt;/span&gt;<br> 
&lt;input type="password" name="account_password" id="accountPassword" required pattern="^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z0-9])(?!.*\s).{12,}$"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Test It</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Save the <span class="fn">registration</span> view and make sure your servers are running.
          </li>
          <li>
            Launch the project <span class="fn">home page</span> and navigate through the <span class="fn">login</span> view to the <span class="fn">registration</span> view.
          </li>
          <li>Try submitting the view with no data. It should not allow it.</li>
          <li>
            Then try submitting the view with broken data in the email and
            password fields. Again, the form should stop and tell you to fix
            errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, try submitting the form with good data. This time no errors
            should appear.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The <span class="fn">Login</span> View</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <span class="fn">login</span> view in <span title='Visual Studio Code'>VSC</span> to alter the form code.</li>
          <li>Make sure the email input type is "email".</li>
          <li>Add the "required" attribute to the email and password inputs.</li>
          <li>
            Add the same reminder as you have in the <span class="fn">registration</span> view
            to the <span class="fn">login</span> view about the password requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the same pattern attribute to the password field in this view as you have in
            the <span class="fn">registration</span> view.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Test It</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Save the <span class="fn">login</span> view and make sure the server is running.</li>
          <li>
            Launch the project <span class="fn">home page</span> and navigate to the <span class="fn">login</span> view.
          </li>
          <li>Try submitting the view with no data. It should not work.</li>
          <li>
            Then try submitting the view with broken data in the email and
            password fields. Again, the form should stop and tell you to fix
            errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, try submitting the form with good data. This time no errors
            should appear. But, since the login process is not operational, it should do nothing.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          As you have seen, with relatively little effort we can add HTML
          attributes and values to forms to make sure data is the right kind in
          most cases or at least not missing in others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "fly in the ointment" is that client-side validation can be turned
          off in the browser. JaveScript can be disabled and using tools such as
          the novalidate! bookmarklet (the installation of which will be done in
          its own activity this week) can disable client-side validation. As a
          result, we cannot rely solely on client-side validation, we
          <b>MUST</b> also have "server-side" validation and that is what we will implement in the next activity.
        </p>

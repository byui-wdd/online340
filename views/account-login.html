        <h1>Account: Deliver Login</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          From the very beginning of the project, you included a "My Account"
          item in the site header. It has remained unused, until now. The
          purpose of this activity is to implement the link, route, controller
          and views to get started with implementing account functionality
          within the project.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Overview</h2>
        <p>The video provides a general overview of the activity, but does not contain the detail needed to complete each process. Watch the video to obtain a general idea, but follow the written steps to complete the activity. This is the <a target="_blank" href="../transcripts/account-deliver-login-view.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>

        <h2>The Login View Route</h2>
        <p>
          If you open the <span class="fn">header.ejs</span>  partial and closely look at the path for
          the "My Account" link, you will see the value that will be sent
          through the Request object to the application. The request expects to
          get back a login view. So, step one is to build an "accounts" router
          file that will handle the request.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using the <span class="fn">inventoryRoute</span> file as an example, build a new <span class="fn">accountRoute.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">routes</span> folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            The file will need access to the following external resources:
            <ul>
              <li>the express package.</li>
              <li>the express.Router() function.</li>
              <li>the <span class="fn">utilities &gt; index</span> file.</li>
              <li>
                an <span class="fn">accounts controller</span> (which you will build later in this
                activity).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a "GET" route for the path that will be sent when the "My
            Account" link is clicked. <span class="notice">Note: within this router file, the route should reflect only the part of the path that follows "account". The <code>account</code> part of the path should be placed in the <span class="fn">server.js</span> file, when this router is required.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            The "GET" route must use a function from the <span class="fn">account controller</span>, to
            handle the request.
          </li>
          <li>Add the error handler middleware to the route to deal with any errors.</li>
          <li>Make sure the route(s) are exported for use elsewhere.</li>
          <li>
            Ensure no warnings or errors are displayed by
            <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Enable the Account Route</h2>
        <p>
          You will recall that the <span class="fn">server.js</span> file is the initial operating document for the project. If a route
          handler is unknown, then the route doesn't do anything.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <span class="fn">server.js</span> file.</li>
          <li>In the "Require Statements" section, require the account route file you just created.</li>
          <li>
            In the "Routes" section, add the "account" route, using the
            Inventory route as an example.
          </li>
          <li>As mentioned earlier, make sure that the "<code>/account</code>" element from the path is placed in the app.use() function as the first element.</li>
          <li>
            Ensure no warnings or errors are displayed by
            <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Account Controller</h2>
        <p>
          With the route in place, the <span class="fn">account controller</span> needs to be built in
          order to process the request and return a view to the browser.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the <span class="fn">controllers</span> folder, create a new <span class="fn">accountController.js</span>  file. This name, follows the convention of the other controller  files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once created, return to the <span class="fn">account router</span> file and make sure the
            name of the controller matches what you are requiring.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, the only item that must be "required" by the controller is
            the <span class="fn">utilities &gt; index.js</span> file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaving a few empty lines below the require statement, add a comment
            and a function that will deliver a login view (you'll build it when
            the controller is done).
          </li>
          <li>
            The login function is shown below:
            <pre
              class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-JavaScript">/* ****************************************
*  Deliver login view
* *************************************** */
async function buildLogin(req, res, next) {
  let nav = await utilities.getNav()
  res.render("account/login", {
    title: "Login",
    nav,
  })
}

module.exports = { buildLogin }
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>An Explanation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lines 1 - 3 -</strong> a multi-line comment introducing
                the function.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Line 4 -</strong> begins the function, declaring it as
                asynchronous, and passing in request, response and next as
                parameters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Line 5 -</strong> retrieves and stores the navigation
                bar string for use in the view.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Line 6 -</strong> calls the render function and
                indicates the view to be returned to the client and opens the
                object that will carry data to the view.
                <span class="notice"
                  >Note: the view is inside a folder, which should be within the

              <li>
                <strong>Lines 7 - 8 -</strong> the data items to be sent to the

              <li>
                <strong>Line 9 -</strong> closes the data object and the render
                function (opened on line 6).
              </li>

                <strong>Line 12 -</strong> exports the function for use
                elsewhere.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure no warnings or errors are displayed by
            <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

<h2>Data Trail</h2>
<p>One of the most difficult tasks is being consistent with data as it moves around within an application. While there are many ways of doing so, a simple, easy to remember, method is to use the database table names for data throughout the application. For example, in the <span class="fn">login</span> view is a form that asks the user to supply an email address and password.</p>
<p>If you look in the <span class="fn">accounts</span> table of the database, you'll see that the email is stored in the <code>account_email</code> field, while the password is stored in the <code>account_password</code> field.</p>
<p>To apply this to the form, you would name the email input as <code>name="account_email"</code>. By using this method, the form and database table locations match. The same idea applies to all form fields.</p>


        <h2>Login View</h2>
        <p>
          With everything else done, it is time to build the login view. As with
          the other views built, it should meet the following specifications:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Created inside a new folder, within the <span class="fn">views</span> folder. The new
            folder name should match the name in the render function of the
            controller.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be named according to the name in the render function of the
            controller.
          </li>
          <li>Use the title data value for both the title and h1 elements.</li>
          <li>Have the ability to display a flash message, if one is sent.</li>
          <li>
            Display a login HTML form that accepts an email address (this will be the username) and password.
          </li>
          <li>
            The form should include a button to submit the login credentials.
          </li>
          <li>Enforcement of the input data does not have to be done at this time.</li>
          <li>
            Beneath the form should be a link that allows the user to send a URL
            that would request delivery of a registration view, if they do not
            yet have an account. Refer to this example:
            <div class="callout">
              <img
                src="/cse340-ww-content/images/login-form.png"
                alt="Image of an example login form." />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add appropriate CSS to render the view and form professionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure no warnings or errors are displayed by
            <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Test Time</h2>
        <p>
          Before going any further, it is important to test the functionality
          that has just been added.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Ensure that all the file names are correct, particularly those
            that are being required by other files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span> terminal and
            start the development server - <code class="language-javascript"
              >pnpm run dev</code
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a browser to "<code class="language-markup">localhost:5500</code
            >".
          </li>
          <li>Click the "My Account" link in the header.</li>
          <li>
            The view should be delivered, and the form is in place and styled.
          </li>
          <li>Test the view against the Frontend checklist.</li>
          <li>
            If everything worked, do a happy dance with someone you love. If
            not, review the terminal logs to see if an error is reported, get
            help from your learning team, the TA, or the professor.
          </li>
          <li>Stop the server when done testing!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The process of using routes, controllers and views is fundamental to
          modern web development. In this instance, it was as much review as new
          content, but soon, you'll be getting serious with saving incoming
          information to the database.

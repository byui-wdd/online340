      <h2>Get Organized</h2>
      <p>
        We'll begin by creating several new files and storing these into
        existing folders.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a new <span class="fn">index.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">database</span> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a new <span class="fn">inventory-model.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">models</span> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a new <span class="fn">baseController.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">controllers</span> folder.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Database Connection</h2>
      <p>
        With the database created, we need a means for our application to talk
        to it. That is what we'll do now.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open the <span class="fn">package.json</span> file.
          <ul>
            <li>Look at the list of dependencies.</li>
            <li>
              You'll find "pg" in the list. "pg" is a short-hand reference to
              the node-postgres package that Express can use to talk with a
              PostgreSQL database.
            </li>
            <li>
              Open the
              <a href="https://node-postgres.com/
" target="_blank">node-postgres Documentation</a>
              in your browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bookmark this documentation, so you can refer back to it as
              needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can close the <span class="fn">package.json</span> file. I just wanted you to know
              that this package was listed and should be installed already.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Find and open the <span class="fn">.env</span> file, which should be at the root of the project. Make sure that the name is ".env" and not ".envsample".</li>
        <li>Add the following code to the <span class="fn">.env</span> file:
          <pre class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-JavaScript">NODE_ENV='development'</code></pre>
          This code helps us to identify when we are working and testing locally vs in a remote, production environment, which will be done later. Save and close the file.
        </li>
        <li>Open the <span class="fn">index.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">database</span> folder.</li>
        <li>
          Add the code shown to the
          <span class="fn">index.js</span> file:
          <pre class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-JavaScript">const { Pool } = require("pg")
require("dotenv").config()
/* ***************
 * Connection Pool
 * SSL Object needed for local testing of app
 * But will cause problems in production environment
 * If - else will make determination which to use
 * *************** */
let pool
if (process.env.NODE_ENV == "development") {
  pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    ssl: {
      rejectUnauthorized: false,
    },
})

// Added for troubleshooting queries
// during development
module.exports = {
  async query(text, params) {
    try {
      const res = await pool.query(text, params)
      console.log("executed query", { text })
      return res
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("error in query", { text })
      throw error
    }
  },
}
} else {
  pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  })
  module.exports = pool
}

          <h3>An Explanation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 1 -</strong> imports the "Pool" functionality from
              the "pg" package. A pool is a collection of connection objects
              (10 is the default number) that allow multiple site visitors to
              be interacting with the database at any given time. This keeps
              you from having to create a separate connection for each
              interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 2 -</strong> imports the "dotenv" package which
              allows the sensitive information about the database location and
              connection credentials to be stored in a separate location and
              still be accessed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 3-8 -</strong> a multi-line comment concerning the
              "ssl" code found in the connection pool function.
              <span class="notice">This is critical code. Be sure to read and understand the comment.</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 9 -</strong> creates a local <code class="language-javascript">pool</code> variable to
              hold the functionality of the "Pool" connection.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Line 10 -</strong> an <code class="language-javascript">if</code> test to see if the code exists in a developent environment, as declared in the .env file. In the production environment, no value will be found.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 11 -</strong> creates a new pool instance from the imported Pool class.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 12 -</strong> indicates how the pool will connect
              to the database (use a connection string) and the value of the
              string is stored in a name - value pair, which is in the .env
              file locally, and in an "environment variable" on a remote
              server. These are equivelent concepts, but different
              implementations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lines 13 through 15 -</strong> describes how the Secure Socket Layer (ssl) is used in the connection to the database, but only in a remote connection, as exists in our development environment.
              <h3>A Short Explanation</h3>
              <p>
                SSL is a means of excrypting the flow of information from one
                network location to another. In this case, when we attempt to
                communicate with the remote database server from our own
                computer the code indicates that the server should not reject
                our connection. However, when we work in a remote production server, the ssl lines must not exist. This is because our application server and the database
                server will be in the same system and their communication will
                be secure, which is what we will require.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 16 -</strong> ends the pool function started on
              line 11.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Line 17 -</strong> left blank.</li>
            <li><strong>Lines 18-19 -</strong> comments related to the function to be exported in lines 21 through 31.</li>
            <li><strong>Lines 20-31 -</strong> exports an asynchronous <code class="language-javascript">query</code> function that accepts the text of the query and any parameters. When the query is run it will add the SQL to the console.log. If the query fails, it will console log the SQL text to the console as an error. This code is primarily for troubleshooting as you develop. As you test the application in your development mode, have the terminal open, and you will see the queries logged into the terminal as each is executed.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 32 -</strong> ends the <code class="language-javascript">if</code> and opens the <code class="language-javascript">else</code> structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 33 -</strong> creates a new "pool" instance from the "Pool" class.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 34 -</strong> indicates the value of the connection string will be found in an environment variable. In the production environment, such a variable will not be stored in our .env file, but in the server's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 35 -</strong> ends the Pool object and instance creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Line 36 -</strong> exports the pool object to be used whenever a database connection is needed. <span class="notice">This is for the production environment, which means the queries will not be entered into the console.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Line 37 -</strong> ends the <code class="language-javascript">else</code> structure.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm that the code is typed correctly and the
          <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span> does not report any
          warnings or errors.
        </li>
        <li>Save and close the file.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Add the Connection String to the <span class="fn">.env</span> file</h2>
      <p>
        In the database file that you just built, the code indicates that the
        connection pool will find the information it needs to talk with the
        database server in the <span class="fn">.env</span> file. Let's get that inserted, so it is there.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In your browser, go to <span class="fn">render.com</span> and login using your GitHub
          credentials.
        </li>
        <li>Open the database server in the dashboard.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to the "Connections" area.</li>
        <li>Click the "Copy" button on the "External Database URL" line.</li>
        <li>
          Open the <span class="fn">.env</span> file in <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a blank line type, <code><mark>DATABASE_URL=</mark></code>, then paste the string copied from <span class="fn">render.com</span>. Make sure there is
          no space in the entire string.
        </li>
        <li>Confirm that no warnings or errors appear in the <span class="fn">.env</span> file.</li>
        <li>Save and close the file.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When you get ready to run and test your application, the database
        connection pool will look in the <span class="fn">.env</span> file for a variable of
        <code class="language-javascript">DATABASE_URL</code>. When found, it will use the connection string to
        attempt to talk to the database server. If successful, the pool will
        then have the ability to run the query in the <span class="fn">inventory-model</span> file,
        which you will build next, and return the data from the server.
      </p>

      <h2>The Inventory Model</h2>
      <p>
        With the database connection pool created we can now use it to begin
        interacting with the database. I hope you'll remember that in an M-V-C
        approach, the "Model" is where all data interactions are stored. Our
        <span class="fn">inventory-model.js</span> document is where we'll write all the
        functions to interact with the classification and inventory tables of
        the database, since they are integral to our inventory.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open the <span class="fn">inventory-model.js</span> file in the <span class="fn">models</span> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type the code shown in the image into the file:
          <pre class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-JavaScript">const pool = require("../database/")

/* ***************************
 *  Get all classification data
 * ************************** */
async function getClassifications(){
  return await pool.query("SELECT * FROM public.classification ORDER BY classification_name")
}

module.exports = {getClassifications}

        <li>
          <h3>An Explanation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 1 -</strong> imports the database connection file
              (named <span class="fn">index.js</span>) from the <span class="fn">database</span> folder which is one level
              above the current file. Because the file is <span class="fn">index.js</span>, it is
              the default file, and will be located inside the <span class="fn">database</span> folder
              without being specified. The path could also be
              <span class="fn">../database/index.js</span>. It would return the same result.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Line 2 -</strong> left intentionally blank.</li>
            <li><strong>Lines 3-5 -</strong> a multi-line comment introducing the function.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 6 -</strong> creates an "asynchronous" function,
              named <code class="language-javascript">getClassifications</code>. An asynchronous function returns a
              <code class="language-javascript">promise</code>, without blocking (stopping) the execution of the code.
              It allows the application to continue and will then deal with
              the results from the <code class="language-javascript">promise</code> when delivered.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 7 -</strong> will return (send back) the result of
              the SQL query, which will be sent to the database server using a
              pool connection, when the resultset (data) or an error, is sent
              back by the database server.
              <mark>Notice the two keywords: return and await. <code class="language-javascript">Await</code> is part of
                the <code class="language-javascript">Async - Await</code> promise structure introduced in ES6.
                <code class="language-javascript">Return</code> is an Express keyword, indicating that the data
                should be sent to the code location that called the function
                originally.</mark>

      <h2>The base controller</h2>
      <p>
        A controller is the location where the logic of the application
        resides. It is responsible for determining what action is to be
        carried out in order to fulfill requests submitted from remote
        clients. The "base" controller will be responsible only for requests
        to the application in general, and not to specific areas (such as
        inventory or accounts).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find and open the <span class="fn">baseController.js</span> file that should be in
          the <span class="fn">controllers</span> folder.
        </li>
        <li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 1 -</strong> imports an <span class="fn">index.js</span> file (which does
              not yet exist) from a <span class="fn">utilities</span> folder (which does not yet
              exist) which is one level above the current location inside the
              <span class="fn">controllers</span> folder.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li><strong>Line 3 -</strong> left intentionally blank.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 4 -</strong> creates an anonymous, asynchronous
              function and assigns the function to <code class="language-javascript">buildHome</code> which acts as a
              method of the <code class="language-javascript">baseController</code> object. In short, this is similar
              in concept to creating a method within a class, where
              <code class="language-javascript">baseController</code> would be the class name and <code class="language-javascript">buildHome</code> would
              be the method. Being asynchronous, it does not block (stop) the
              application from executing while it awaits the results of the
              function to be returned. The function itself accepts the
              <code class="language-javascript">request</code> and <code class="language-javascript">response</code> objects as parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 5 -</strong> calls a <code class="language-javascript">getNav()</code> function that will
              be found in the <span class="fn">utilities &gt; index.js</span> file. The results, when
              returned (notice the "await" keyword), will be stored into the
              <code class="language-javascript">nav</code> variable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 6 -</strong> is the Express command to use EJS to
              send the <span class="fn">index</span> view back to the client, using the <code class="language-javascript">response</code>
              object. The <span class="fn">index</span> view will need the "title" name - value
              pair, and the <code class="language-javascript">nav</code> variable. The <code class="language-javascript">nav</code> variable will contain the
              string of HTML code to render this dynamically generated navigation bar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Line 7 -</strong> ends the function started on line 4.

<h2>Differences in Implementation</h2>
<p>In the <span class="fn">inventory-model.js</span> file, you should have noticed that the function was created, and then exported within an unnamed object, e.g.:</p>
<code class="language-JavaScript">module.exports = { getClassifications }</code>
<p>However, in the <span class="fn">baseController.js</span> file, a named object was created on line 2:</p>
<code>const baseController = {}</code>
<p>Then, the function was built as a named method of the object on line 4:
 <code class="language-JavaScript">baseController.buildHome = async function(req, res) { ...</code> 
  </p>
  <p>At the bottom of the controller the named object is exported:
    <code class="language-JavaScript">module.exports = baseController</code>
    </p>

    <p>Both of these methods do the exact same thing. In fact, there are additional ways of doing the same thing. But the code found in the examples throughout the course are limited to these two. You may ask, "Why not use one way for everything?" The answer is that different organizations approach things differently, and we want you to see and use a variety. <i><b>Just know, this approach is intentional.</b></i></p>
    
      <h2>Alter the "Index Route"</h2>
      <p>
        With the model and controller in place, it is time to alter the route
        to deliver the <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> view using the entire M-V-C approach.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find and open the <span class="fn">server.js</span> file, at the root of the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Locate the "Require Statements" area, near the top of the file. Add
          a new require statement to bring the base controller into scope:
        </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="callout"><code class="language-javascript">const baseController = require("./controllers/baseController")</code></div>
        <ol start="3">
        <li>Save the file.</li>
        <li>Locate the "Index" route in the "Routes" area of the file.</li>
        <li>
          Alter the route to match this image:
          <div class="callout">
            <img src="/cse340-ww-content/images/call-base-controller-method.png" alt="Screenshot of code to call the base controller method in the server.js file." />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>An Explanation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Previously the <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> view was rendered directly in the route.
              While it worked, it did not follow the M-V-C methodology.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new code uses the imported "baseController" to "call" the
              "buildHome" method.
            </li>
            <li>
              This will execute the function in the controller, build the
              navigation bar and pass it and the title name-value pair to the
              <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> view, which will then be sent to the client.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          While we are close to testing, there is one more loose thread to tie
          up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm that the code is typed correctly and the
          <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span> does not report any
          warnings or errors.
        </li>
        <li>Save and close the file.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Build the Utilities file and functions</h2>
      <p>
        In the <span class="fn">baseController</span> file we wrote code to import a file from the
        <span class="fn">utilities</span> folder. That file will contain a function, which will use the inventory model to get the data from the database, then will build an HTML unordered list around the data. The finished HTML will be sent back as a string to be used in the <span class="fn">navigation</span> partial to render the
        actual navigation bar, based on the vehicle classification found in
        the database. Let's build the function, then test.
      </p>

      <h3>The "getNav" Function</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span> click at the very
          bottom of the explorer pane so that no folder or file is selected.
        </li>
        <li>Click the "New File..." icon.</li>
        <li>
          Type "<code class="language-javascript">utilities/index.js</code>", press the "Enter" key.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new folder named <span class="fn">utilities</span> should appear with an <span class="fn">index.js</span> file
          within it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The new <span class="fn">index.js</span> file should be open in the work area. If not,
          open it.
        </li>
        <li>
          This file will hold functions that are "utility" in nature, meaning
          that we will reuse them over and over, but they don't directly
          belong to the M-V-C structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the file, type the code shown below:
          <pre class="line-numbers" title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it." ><code class="language-JavaScript">const invModel = require("../models/inventory-model")
const Util = {}

/* ************************
 * Constructs the nav HTML unordered list
 ************************** */
Util.getNav = async function (req, res, next) {
  let data = await invModel.getClassifications()
  let list = "&lt;ul&gt;"
  list += '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/" title="Home page"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'
  data.rows.forEach((row) =&gt; {
    list += "&lt;li&gt;"
    list +=
      '&lt;a href="/inv/type/' +
      row.classification_id +
      '" title="See our inventory of ' +
      row.classification_name +
      ' vehicles"&gt;' +
      row.classification_name +
      "&lt;/a&gt;"
    list += "&lt;/li&gt;"
  })
  list += "&lt;/ul&gt;"
  return list
}

      <p>
        If you look at the code (lines 7 to 24) carefully, it should be
        somewhat familiar. It simply keeps adding strings to a variable. When
        done, the entire string is nothing more than an HTML unordered list
        that contains some anchor elements. When the function is done building
        the string, the variable is sent to where the function was called.
      </p>

      
      <h3>Where does this leave us?</h3>
      <p>
        The flow of the M-V-C for our application runs something like this, so
        far:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A client types or clicks a link containing the index route of our
          application.
        </li>
        <li>That triggers a <code class="language-javascript">request</code> to our <span class="fn">server.js</span> page.</li>
        <li>
          The route is found in the page, which calls the function in the
          <span class="fn">baseController</span> file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The controller calls the <code class="language-javascript">getNav</code> function and awaits the result to
          be returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the finished string is returned, it is stored in the <code class="language-javascript">nav</code>
          variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The controller, then tells Express and EJS to send the <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> file back to the client, and send the nav string and title
          name-value pair along with it. These items will be used in the
          <span class="fn">head.ejs</span> and <span class="fn">navigation.ejs</span> partials.
        </li>
        <li>
          The server builds the finished <span class="fn">home</span> page and sends it to the browser.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Adjust the <span class="fn">navigation.ejs</span> Partial File</h2>
      <p>
        With all the code in place, there is one more minor change to be
        made, then we can test.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find and open the <span class="fn">navigation.ejs</span> file in the <span class="fn">partials</span> folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlight and delete the existing unordered list that you typed as
          static code previously.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type this code where the previous code was located:
          <code class="language-javascript">&lt;&percnt;- nav &percnt;&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          When done, the <span class="fn">navigation.ejs</span> partial should look like this:
          <div class="callout">
            <img src="/cse340-ww-content/images/nav-partial-finished.png" alt="Screenshot of code for the finished navigation.ejs partial file." />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm that the code is typed correctly and the
          <span title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</span> does not report any
          warnings or errors.
        </li>
        <li>Save and close the file.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Time to Test</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Save all of your work.</li>
        <li>Open a new <span title='Visual Studio Code'>VSC</span> terminal window.</li>
        <li>Type <code class="language-javascript">pnpm run dev</code>, press "Enter".</li>
        <li>The node server should start showing that it is running on localhost:5500</li>
        <li>In a browser, type <code class="language-markup">http://localhost:5500/</code>.</li>
        <li>If things work as they should, you should be looking at your home
          page.
        </li>
        <li>Hover your mouse over any of the navigation items. You should now see a tooltip generated from the title attribute. You'll recall that the original, static, navigation items did not have this. But, your dynamic navigation items do!</li>
        <li>You should also be able to look in the terminal pane and see the query that was run when the page loaded. It is the same query that exists in the <span class="fn">inventory-model</span>, and is being written in the terminal as part of the code we placed in the database pool code, found in the <span class="fn">database &gt; index.js</span> file.</li>
        <li>
          If things didn't work, check spelling, file and folder names and the
          path. Talk to your learning team, the TA or the professor. Be sure that you can get it to work.
        </li>
        <li><span class="notice">When done testing, be sure to stop the server with <b>Control + C</b> in the terminal.</span></li>

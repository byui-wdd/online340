        <h1>Update Inventory Information (Step 2)</h1>
        <h2>Updating is a Two-Step Process</h2>
        <p>
          An update requires two steps: 1) Once it is determined an update is
          occurring, the information to be changed has to be requested from the
          database and made available to be edited; 2) When the edit is
          completed, the data must then be stored back into the database and the
          user informed of the success or failure of the change. This document
          covers step 2: Making changes to the data, submitting it to the
          server, checking the data and ultimately updating the data to the
          database and notifying the site visitor of the outcome. Step 1 in the
          update process was covered in the
          <a href="update-one.html" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank"
            >Step 1 activity</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>The video provides a general overview of the activity, but does not contain the detail needed to complete each process. Watch the video to obtain a general idea, but follow the written steps to complete the activity. This is the <a target="_blank" href="../transcripts/update-step2.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TuVCPUUGCEE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2>The Update View</h2>
        <p>
          The view where the data will be modified is nearly complete. The form
          inputs should display the data that was queried from the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is equally important is that the view should already have the
          means to display error messages and be "sticky" if incomplete data is
          submitted to the controller and is returned for correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the data was inserted into the form for editing, what was not
          included was the inventory id. This is a critical value that
          will be needed to actually do the update in the database. Let's
          include it into the form.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the view where the update inventory form is located.</li>
          <li>
            Scroll to the bottom of the form and locate the "submit" button or
            input.
          </li>
          <li>Below the "submit" button or input add an empty line.</li>
          <li>
            In the empty line, add a hidden input containing the name - value
            pair, which looks like this:
            <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;input type="hidden" name="inv_id"
&lt;% if(locals.inv_id) { %&gt; value="&lt;%= locals.inv_id %&gt;"
&lt;% } %&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            This allows us to submit the primary key for the item without it
            being obvious to the client looking at the form. In addition, if the
            page is included for error correction the value of the primary key
            (from the error check process) is returned and re-inserted into the
            hidden field.
          </li>
          <li>Ensure that there are no warnings or errors.</li>
          <li>Save the view.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Inventory Route</h2>
        <p>
          As with all of our processes, there needs to be an appropriate route
          handler to watch for and direct the incoming request to the controller
          for processing. Let's make sure that route is present.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find and open the inventory route file in the routes folder.</li>
          <li>
            Add a new route with comment to handle the incoming request, like
            so:
            <pre
              class="line-numbers"
              title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it."
            ><code class="language-javascript">router.post("/update/", invController.updateInventory)</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Notice that "update" matches the value in the form's action
            attribute.
          </li>
          <li><mark>The error handler is not shown in the example above, be sure you add it to your route!</mark></li>
          <li>
            The controller method does not exist, but we will create it in a few
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Ensure there are no warnings or errors.</li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Data Checking Middleware</h2>
        <p>
          The data incoming from the update process should meet the same
          requirements as the original data during the "add" process. But, we
          are now also passing the inv_id and if there are errors, they need to
          be redirected to the "edit" view, not the "add" view. So, some
          modifications are in order.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Find and open the "inventory-validation" file in the "utilities"
            folder.
          </li>
          <li>Copy the "checkInventoryData" function and its comment.</li>
          <li>
            Paste the copied comment and function immediately beneath the just
            copied function, leaving at least one empty line between the old and
            new functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the comment to reflect that errors will be directed back to
            the edit view.
          </li>
          <li>Change the function name to "checkUpdateData".</li>
          <li>
            Add the "inv_id" to the list of variables to hold data from the
            request body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the render view to the "edit" view for inventory items.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the title: to be the same as the title when delivering the
            edit view in the inventory controller.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the "inv_id" to the list of variables being sent back to the
            view in the data object.
          </li>
          <li>Make sure no warnings or errors exist in the file.</li>
          <li>Save the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          With the file changed, add the "newInventoryRules()" function and the
          "checkUpdateData" middleware to the "update" route in the
          inventoryRoute file. Similar to the middleware used in the "add new
          inventory" route.
        </p>

        <h2>The Inventory Controller</h2>
        <p>
          As with all other processes, the controller is responsible for the
          logic to carry out the update for the data sent from the view and
          report the result back to the client. Because much of this process is
          similar to that of adding an item to inventory, we will do some copy and paste
          to make this process go faster:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the inventory controller.</li>
          <li>
            Locate and copy the function used to insert a new inventory item, including
            the comment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, find the function which queried the data from the database and
            built the edit view. Click below it, creating a few empty lines, if
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paste the copied code into the second empty line. Be sure there is
            an empty line between the previous function and the newly pasted
            function.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the new function in place, let's edit it to not "Add" a new
            item, but to carry out the "Update" of the item, like this:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <pre
          class="line-numbers"
          title="Copy - Paste does NOT help you learn. Type it."

              can move on. If not, ask someone else in your learning team about

        <h2>Inventory Model</h2>
        <p>
          Finally we will create the updateInventory() function and then be ready
          to test. I hope you have already guessed that we will create this
          function by copying and editing your "add inventory" function, since
          they are so similar.

        <h2>Test One</h2>
        <p>
          Double check that all files worked with during this activity
          (inventory route, inventory controller, inventory model, update
          inventory view) have no errors.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure the development servers are running.</li>
          <li>Open the project application in a browser.</li>
          <li>
            Navigate to the login view and login as an employee or
            administrator.
          </li>
          <li>Navigate to the inventory management view.</li>
          <li>Select a classification from the select list.</li>
          <li>Click the "Modify" link for one of the items.</li>
          <li>
            The item information should load into the form in the
            <b>update</b> view.
          </li>
          <li>Right-click on the page and do a "View Page Source".</li>
          <li>
            Look at the code and find the "hidden" input where the inv_id value
            of the inventory item should be stored. Make sure it is there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return to the form and change something, just one thing for right
            now.
          </li>
          <li>Submit the form.</li>
          <li>
            If things worked you should be returned to the
            <b>inventory management</b> view, and you should see the success
            message.
          </li>
          <li>
            To confirm the change, you can do one of two things:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bring up the same item in the management view and click the
                "modify" link for the item that was just updated. Does the
                change appear in the input?
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the navigation bar item for the classification that included the
                item that was just changed. Click the item to see the
                details. Does the change appear in the detail view?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If everything worked, do a fist pump over your head and feel proud
            of yourself. If not, review your code and do some troubleshooting,
            get help from a learning team member or someone else.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Test Two</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click the "modify" option for an inventory item. In the update view, submit
            the form again, but without making a change.
          </li>
          <li>You should be returned to the <span class="fn">management</span> view with a success message.</li>
          <li>
            While this does no harm, it takes time and uses server resources that need not be used.
          </li>
          <li>Let's fix this.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>A JavaScript Function</h2>
          <p>We will write a small JavaScript function and attach it to the <span class="fn">edit-inventory</span> view. This function will not allow the "Update" button from executing unless some data has changed.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find and click the <span class="fn">public &gt; js</span> folder to select it.</li>
  <li>Click the "New File" icon and create a new JavaScript file, named <span class="fn">inv-update.js</span>.</li>
  <li>Add this code to the file, then save.</li>
  </ol>
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">const form = document.querySelector("#updateForm")
    form.addEventListener("change", function () {
      const updateBtn = document.querySelector("button")
      updateBtn.removeAttribute("disabled")
    })</code></pre>
    <ol start="4">
  <li>Open the <span class="fn">edit-inventory</span> view.</li>
  <li>Add an id to the opening form tag with the value of "updateForm".</li>
  <li>Add the "disabled" attribute to the button.</li>
  <li>Link the remote JavaScript file containing the function you just wrote to the view using a &lt;script&gt; element and remember to NOT include the <span class="fn">public</span> folder in the file path.</li>
  <li>If you used an &lt;input type="submit"&gt; in the form, rather than a &lt;button&gt;, then adjust the JavaScript function to work with it.</li>
  <li>Save the view.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Test Three</h2>
          <li>
            Ensure the server is running.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go through the process to select an inventory item to edit.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the <span class="fn">edit-inventory</span> view loads, the submit button should be disabled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change something in the form. Anything.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Submit button should become enabled after the change.
          </li>
          <li>
            If everything worked - Congratulations (<i
              >Crowd cheering in the background</i
            >)!
          </li>
          <li>If not, troubleshoot and get help until it is operational.</li>
          <li>Stop the servers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While the client-side JavaScript can be turned off, this is an easy solution to prevent submitting the form if no data is changed in the form.</p>

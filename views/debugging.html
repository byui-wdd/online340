      <h1>Debugging in VS Code</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Undoubtedly, you have had errors in your code as you have worked in the course. This short exercise is meant to introduce you to some basic debugging techniques.</p>

      <h2>Watch the Video</h2>
      <p>Here is a short, 6-minute video showing the essential debugging process of a Node application in VS Code. Just watch it the first time through.</p>

      <h2>Alternative Video</h2>
      <p>This video is longer, but covers more options and also uses a more realistic situation with an error in a function. The VS Code debugger portion begins at around 9:30. </p>

      <h2>Create the launch.json debugger file</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In the VS Code debugger tool, click the "create  a launch.json file" link just below the "Run and Debug" button.</li>
        <li>When the file opens, click between the square brackets in the "configurations" item.</li>
        <li>Begin typing "launch". In the options list that appears, select "Node.js: Launch Program". <br>
          <img src="../images/debug-launch-node.png" alt="Node js launch program option">
        </li>
        <li>Alter the code to look like the image below: <br>

        </li>
        <li>Save the file.</li>
      </ol>
<h2>Try it out</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Open one of the model files and intentionally implement an error into the SQL code.</li>
        <li>Following the process shown in the video, set a breakpoint in a controller that makes use of the model into which the error was created.</li>
        <li>Use the debugger to view the variables and functions until you can identify the issue in the debugger.</li>
        <li>When you feel confident that you can do this, exit the debugger and fix the error.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Paired Programming Exercise</h2>
<p>Now that you have a small bit of experience on you own, it's time to practice while working with another member of your learning team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Arrange with another member of your learning team to meet together. Give yourselves between 30 and 60 minutes to do this activity.</li>
  <li>Just like you did before, introduce an error into your code (know where it is at, so you can fix it when you're done, if needed.)</li>
  <li>If meeting in a classroom where you are both physically present, just trade computers to do the debugging. One will debug while the owner observes.</li>
  <li>If in an online class, <mark>complete this in your Learning Team meeting, and complete the Learning Team report before leaving the meeting.</mark> One will share their VS Code application, and the one doing the debugging will request control and do the debugging using the Zoom interface. See <a href="https://www.helpwire.app/blog/zoom-remote-control/" target="_blank">How to use Remote Control on Zoom</a> for more information. Each person will take only 50% of the time maximum, while the other person watch. Then trade.</li>
  <li><strong>Only set breakpoints and use the debugger to find the error. Fix the issue ONLY with the permission of the code owner! Do NOT change any other code.</strong></li>
</ol>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The intent is NOT to make you a professional debugger in one activity; rather, to expose you to the debugger tool and give you some practice. <b>I strongly encourage you to use the debugger when you encounter issues to gain more experience finding and fixing code issues.</b></p>

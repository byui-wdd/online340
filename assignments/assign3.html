      <h1>Assignment 3 Directions</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This week's activities saw us implementing dynamic code for the navigation bar, delivering inventory items by classification, become familiar with debugging, and implementing error handling. This assignment will expand each of these concepts, except for debugging, which is constant and ongoing.
      </p>

      <h2>Video Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This short video demonstrates what the finished assignment may look like and the functionality it could possess. This is the <a target="_blank" href="../transcripts/assignment3.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>
      <h3>Task One</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Using the activities related to delivering the inventory items by classification view as an example, build a process to deliver a specific inventory item detail view. <span class="notice">Note: This will be a <b>single view</b>, which will allow any vehicle's information to be displayed, based on the parameters passed through the URL.</span> <span class="warning">It is NOT a separate view for each item.</span></li>
        <li>The detail delivery process must include:
          <ol>
            <li>an appropriate route as part of the <span class="fn">inventory route</span> file,</li>
            <li>a controller function, which is part of the <span class="fn">inventory controller</span>,</li>
            <li>a function to retrieve the data for a specific vehicle in inventory, based on the inventory id (this should be a single function, not a separate one for each vehicle), which is part of the <span class="fn">inventory-model</span>,</li>
            <li>
              Build a custom function in the <span class="fn">utilities &gt; index.js</span> file that
              will take the specific vehicle's information and wrap it up in HTML
              to deliver to the view, </li>
            <li>The view must be created and stored in the <span class="fn">views &gt; inventory</span> folder and meet these specifications:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Display the vehicle make and model in the title element and in the main content heading.
                </li>
                <li>Use the full-size image, not the thumbnail image.</li>
                <li>
                  The make, model, year and price should be prominent in the view. All descriptive data must also be displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The price must display as U.S. Dollars with appropriate currency
                  symbol and proper place value commas.
                </li>
                <li>The mileage must display with proper place value commas.</li>
                <li>
                  Each item must be displayed with appropriate supporting text to make sense to a site visitor. See this image from Enterprise car sales as an example:<br />
                  <img src="/cse340-ww-content/images/car-example.jpg" alt="Example of a car detail view from Enterprise car sales" />
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meet the standards shown in the
                  <a href="/cse340-ww-content/views/dev-checklist.html" title="Open the web development checklist in a new tab" target="_blank">Frontend Checklist</a>
                  and display the vehicle information for easy reading and
                  presenting a professional appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="notice">For large screens, the image and content must sit side-by-side
                    (similar to the example car image). On small screens, the content should stack into a single column.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The content (including images) must be responsive and maintain its clarity of
                  presentation in the browser as the browser window grows or
                  shrinks. No horizontal scrolling or zooming should be required, and the content should adapt to the screen and not overflow it.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Task 2</h3>
           <p>Apply the error handling middleware, from the activities, to all routes throughout the application. Make sure each process is included to catch and report errors should they occur in the application. You should test to make sure this works, but do NOT leave any intentional errors in place other than the one called for in task 3.</p>

          <h3>Task 3</h3>
          <p>Implement an intentional error process into the application (including a route, controller and middleware) that will generate a 500-type error. Add a link to trigger the route to the <span class="fn">footer partial</span> file. Make sure that when the link is clicked that the process is directed through a router and controller (these can be existing routers and controller or new just for this task), but the middleware catches the error and redirects to the error view. Ensure that the error view meets the requirements of the frontend checklist. See <a href="https://rollbar.com/blog/handling-node-js-exceptions/#" target="_blank">Throw exceptions in Node</a> for a suggested means of causing the error to trigger.</p>

          <h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
          <p>Be sure to complete all tasks and then test that they work.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Load the project to GitHub, then deploy to your render.com server.
            </li>
            <li>Load the site into your browser.</li>
            <li>Click a link in the main navigation bar.</li>
            <li>
              From the classification view that should be presented in the
              browser click the link for any vehicle.
            </li>
            <li>
              The details should be visible in a new view. The details
              are clear, professional in appearance that can be easily consumed by
              the human looking at the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change the screen size to emulate delivery to various device sizes.
              The content should be responsive and adjust to allow clear
              presentation regardless of screen size.
            </li>
            <li>Check the view for HTML and CSS validity and WAVE compliance.</li>
            <li>
              Repeat multiple times (clicking on navigation link, then "drilling
              down" to the detail) to ensure that the process works with
              all vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>Test for a non-existent view using a fake route. A 404 error should be delivered via the error view.</li>
            <li>Click the error link in the footer. A 500 error should be delivered via the error view.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Submission</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Work with your learning team to accomplish the tasks and post to and read the weekly discussion board to help one another.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build, run and test to make sure that each of the tasks works.
            </li>
            <li>
              When satisfied that the code is operational:
              <ol>
                <li>Upload the project to your GitHub repository.</li>
                <li>Go to the render.com dashboard and manually deploy to your web service.</li>
                <li>Thoroughly test the application in the browser on the production server following deployment.</li>
                <li>Fix any and all errors prior to submission.</li>
                <li>Submit the render.com production URL <b>AND</b> the GitHub repository URL as a comment in the assignment submission.</li>
              </ol>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
          <p>

      <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
      
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This assignment is a review of the concepts, skills and techniques that should have been learned in previous Web Frontend Development course(s). It requires you to apply these previous skills to work with the documents and processes from the activities, for a fictitious car dealership - <b>CSE Motors</b>.
      </p>
      <h2>When done, you will have:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Altered the existing <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> view and the existing partial files as needed to provide a home view for the car dealership.</li>
        <li>The resulting page will meet the standards shown in the <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse340-ww-content/views/dev-checklist.html" title="Open the web development checklist in a new tab" target="_blank">Frontend
            Checklist</a>.</li>
        <li>The page will use EJS partials for the <span class="fn">head</span>, <span class="fn">header</span>, <span class="fn">navigation</span>, and <span class="fn">footer</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="fn">index</span> page will include the content shown in the sample images (mobile and large screens).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notice!</h2>
      <p class="notice">All code must be your own. No outside templates, frameworks, code copied from the Internet, or another individual are acceptable for this assignment or future assignments in the course. Submission of work which violates this standard will result in a zero for the assignment and referral to the standards' office for disciplinary action.</p>

      <h3>Video Overview</h3>
      <p>This video provides a brief demonstration of what your finished assignment should look like and how it should behave once done. This is the <a target="_blank" href="../transcripts/assignment1.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>
      </p>

      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <p>This enhancement assumes that you can code semantic and valid HTML5, CSS3 (including the use of media queries
        and responsive layouts) and implement basic usability concepts. The resource materials listed at the top of this document are meant to help brush up with these skills as needed.</p>

      <h2>Downloads</h2>
      <p>The starter folder that you downloaded and implemented earlier contains the images and static folders needed. It is assumed that the routes, EJS layout and partials are fully operational from completing the activities.</p>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>

      <h3>Build the CSE Motors Home View</h3>
      <p>Modify the existing <span class="fn">index.ejs</span> file and partials as needed to produce the CSE Motors home view. The view must contain the content as shown in the images below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <figure><img src="/cse340-ww-content/images/home-large.png" alt="Picture of the CSE Motors home page for large screen" style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 75%;">
            <figcaption><i>CSE Motors home - Large Screen</i></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure><img style="max-width: 320px;" src="/cse340-ww-content/images/home-mobile.png" alt="Picture of the CSE Motors home page for mobile screen" style="border: 1px solid #000;">
            <figcaption><i>CSE Motors home - Mobile Screen</i></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>The content images (shown in the pictures) are found in the <span class="fn">public &gt; images</span> folder.</li>
        <li>Write and implement CSS to position the page content to match as closely as possible the provided images for both large screen and mobile screen layouts.</li>
        <li>Include the <code class="language-markup">media="screen"</code> attribute for the CSS link element, </li>
        <li>Use a color scheme of your own choosing. However,
          <span class="notice">selected colors must pass accessibility contrast checks with no errors.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Use fonts of your choice, but they should provide a professional, easy to read, look and feel.</li>
        <li>Be fully responsive to a variety of devices so that the content loads without horizontal scrolling or
          zooming
          (see the video illustration below), </li>
        <li>Meet usability standards as checked using the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" title="Open the WAVE site in a new tab" target="_blank">WAVE browser
            extension</a>. No accessibility or contrast errors should be present.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use external CSS for all styling. The CSS must:
          <ul>
            <li>be stored in the provided <span class="fn">public &gt; css</span> folder, </li>
            <li>start with a mobile first approach (this means that CSS for mobile devices is outside media
              queries), </li>
            <li>be responsive to varying screen sizes of a variety of devices, </li>
            <li>use media queries for responsive layout only for larger screen sizes (don't go overboard here, limit the
              number of media queries to one or two - but remember that CSS inside media queries adjusts styles for
              larger devices), </li>
            <li>be of your own writing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>be valid HTML5 and CSS3 code.</li>
      </ol>
